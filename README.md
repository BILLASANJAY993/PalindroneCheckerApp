# PalindroneCheckerApp
//UC6: Queue + Stack Based Palindrome Check
//Goal: Demonstrate FIFO vs LIFO using Queue and Stack.
//Flow:
//Enqueue characters
//Push characters to stack
//Compare dequeue vs pop
//Key Concepts used in UC6:
//Queue – A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
//Enqueue & Dequeue Operations – Used to insert and remove elements from the queue.
//Stack vs Queue – Demonstrates the behavioral difference between LIFO and FIFO structures.
//Logical Comparison – Matching dequeue (queue) output with pop (stack) output to validate palindrome logic.
//Data Structures: Queue, Stack
