//UC5: Stack-Based Palindrome Checker
//Goal: Use stack to reverse characters and validate palindrome.
//Flow:
//Push characters into stack
//Pop and compare
//Print result
//Key Concepts used in UC5:
//Stack – A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
//Push Operation – Used to insert characters into the stack.
//Pop Operation – Used to remove characters from the stack in reverse order.
//Reversal Logic – Stack naturally reverses the order of elements, making it suitable for palindrome validation.
//Data Structure: Stack
