# PalindroneCheckerApp
//UC9: Recursive Palindrome Checker
//Goal: Check palindrome using recursion.
//Flow:
//Recursive call compares start & end
//Base condition exits recursion
//Key Concepts used in UC9:
//Recursion – A technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.
//Base Condition – Prevents infinite recursion and terminates the recursive calls.
//Call Stack – Memory structure used to manage method calls during recursion.
//Data Structure: Call Stack
