//UC3: Palindrome Check Using String Reverse
//Goal: Check whether a string is a palindrome by reversing it.
//Flow:
//Reverse string using loop
//Compare original and reversed
//Display result
//Key Concepts used in UC3:
//Loop (for loop) – Used to iterate through the characters of the string in reverse order.
//String Immutability – In Java, String objects are immutable; every modification creates a new String object.
//String Concatenation (+) – Used to build the reversed string character by character (introduced here to later discuss drawbacks).
//equals() Method – Used to compare the actual content of two String objects instead of memory references.
//Data Structure: String
