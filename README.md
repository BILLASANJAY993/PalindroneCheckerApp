//UC2: Print a Hardcoded Palindrome Result
//Goal: Display whether a hardcoded string is a palindrome.
//Actor: User
//Flow:
//Program starts
//Hardcoded string is checked
//Result is printed
//Program exits


//Key Concepts used in UC2:
//Class – In Java, even the simplest program must be written inside a class, as a class acts as a container to hold program logic.
//Main Method – Entry point of the Java application with the signature
//public static void main(String[] args).
//Static Keyword – Allows the JVM to invoke the main() method without creating an object of the class.
//String – A built-in Java class used to store and manipulate textual data. Here, it stores the word to be checked for a palindrome.
//String Literal – Text enclosed within double quotes ("madam"), stored in the String constant pool.
//Conditional Statement (if-else) – Used to evaluate whether the given string satisfies the palindrome condition.
//Console Output – System.out.println() is used to display the result on the console.
