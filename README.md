//UC12: Strategy Pattern for Palindrome Algorithms (Advanced)
//Goal: Choose a palindrome algorithm dynamically.
//Flow:
//Define PalindromeStrategy interface
//Implement StackStrategy, DequeStrategy
//Inject strategy at runtime
//Key Concepts used in UC12:
//Interface
//Polymorphism
//Strategy Pattern
//Data Structure: Varies per strategy
